# Tauri Devs Bi-Weekly Meeting Notes

## Apr 07, 2023

### Agenda

-   CI release schedule
    -   Define CI workflow. Can covector handle such job?
    -   How long for a release?
    -   ~~Should they sync/share same version?~~
    -   Should alpha and beta release at the same time?

## Action Items

-   can we provide a way for someone to test out both JS and crates from a PR?
-   release from multiple branches
-   is there a way we can decrease the knowledge gap between core contributors
    and WG or new contributors?

## Benefits of Releases and Scheduling

-   a soft schedule with a manual deploy deals with the human elements
-   providing audit checkouts
-   providing checkpoints for users of Tauri to continue to stay up to date
-   the PRs can be prioritized and have a low-level of expectation to land a PR
    in a specific scheduled release
-   with a priority list and a schedule, we can perhaps gain more eyes moving
    people from trying alpha releases to trying updates earlier and earlier
    (eventually to helping in a PR review)

## Types of Code Review

-   code is functional within ecosystem and future changes (deep knowledge
    required)
-   code quality review (more modularity will make this easier and require less
    deep knowledge)
-   code achieves the goal(s) and path forward as intended (the OP and adjecent
    people that are interested in seeing this PR land)
-   code doesn't break anything else in the ecosystem and doesn't hinder future
    goals (effectively checked at the scheduled alpha releases by WG and greater
    community, and also by the audit team as that is a convenient audit point)
